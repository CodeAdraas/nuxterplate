# What is this package?
This package contains a set of Nuxt (^3.0.0) composables and plugins I use in pretty much all of my Nuxt projects.
- Smooth scroll (Lenis)
- Window width breakpoint utilities (uses Tailwind like @media queries)
- Reactive state that syncs with window.localStorage
- RAF (performant request animation frame)
- SplitType (line/text/word splitting animation on scroll)
- Browser detect
- Image lazy loading
- Debounce
- HTML5 forms that behave mostly natively (easily extendable)
- Cloudflare Turnstile captcha (can be set globally)
- Swiper slider
- FAQ component (uses Prismic CMS data fields)

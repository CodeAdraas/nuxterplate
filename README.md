# What is this package?
This package contains a set of Nuxt (^3.0.0) components, composables and plugins I use in pretty much all of my Nuxt projects.
- Debounce
- HTML5 form and form field components that mostly rely on native browser behaviour (easily extendable)
- Reactive object state that syncs with window.localStorage
- FAQ component (uses Prismic CMS rich text fields for both question and answer)
- Window width breakpoint utilities (uses Tailwind like @media queries for breakpoints)

- Image lazy loading (Uses LazyLoad from verlok-cn)
- RAF (more performant request animation frame, original code from @studiofreight)

- Swiper slider
- Smooth scroll (Uses Lenis from @studiofreight)
- SplitType (line/text/word splitting animation on scroll, uses SplitType from Luke Peavey)
- Browser detect (Uses browser detect from Kenneth Ceyer)
